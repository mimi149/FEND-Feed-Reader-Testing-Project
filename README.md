# FEND Feed Reader Testing Project
(6th project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree Program.)
The web app testing is for the RSS feed reader functionality (RSS Feeds, property defines, menu default status, slide menu toggle)
This testing program is written using Jasmine framework.

### How it works
When page loads, the test results will be displayed at the bottom of the page.
Tests are independent from each other.
